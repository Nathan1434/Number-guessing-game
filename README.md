# Number Guessing Game

This is a "guess the number" made with JavaScript. It is the first project I made with JavaScript and it shows.

## How to play

Well, it's simple. Try and guess the random number in the range specified, in as few attempts as possible.
The game comes with a history mode, so you can see any previous guesses you made. Pretty neat, huh?

If there are any bugs or problems with the game, you can create an issue or pull request and I will try to fix it.

Okay! Enjoy😁
