# Number Guessing Game

## Description

This is a "Guess the Number" game made with JavaScript. It is my first JavaScript project and it shows.

## How to play

Well, it's simple. Try and guess the random number in the range specified, in as few attempts as possible.
The game comes with a history mode, so you can see any previous guesses you made. Pretty neat, huh?

Okay! EnjoyüòÅ
